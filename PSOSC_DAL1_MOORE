# Lesson 1 ####

# Lesson 2 ####

# Let's Try Some Basic Arithmetic
# Sum of 1 and 1
1+1

# Divide 365 by 12
365/12

# Your turn, multiply 10 by 12
# Your turn, add 28+38
28+38

# Order of Operations in R
1+1*(365/12)

# Learning to assign variables ####

#Run this line of code to assign your first variable.my
FirstVar<- "Hello world!"

# Run myFirstVar in the console.
myFirstVar

# Code a second variable with a number.
mySecondVar<-16

# Run myFirstVar in the console.
mySecondVar

#Now let's practice assigning variables.
# Assign "Clemson" to`home`
home <- "Clemson"

# Assign "Tigers" to`h_mascot`
h_mascot <- "Tigers"

# Assign "Ohio State" to`away

# Assign'Buckeyes'to`a_mascot`

# Assign 31 to``
homeScore <- 31

# Assign 0 to`awayScore`

# Assign TRUE to homeWin
homeWin<- TRUE

# Assign FALSE to awayWin
awayWin<- FALSE

# Use class to identify the data type for the following variables.
class(h_mascot)
class(homeScore)
class(homeWin)

# Use str to identify the data types for the following variables
str(h_mascot)
str(homeScore)
str(homeWin)

# Can sports scores ever be represented as decimals? No. We need to convert the`homeScore`and`awayScore`
# Convert `homeScore` to interger and assign to same var name
homeScore <- as.integer(homeScore)
homeScore

# Now it is your turn.

# Convert `awayScore` to interger and assign to same var name.

# Make a numeric vector by using the syntax`c(#,#,#,#)`; check its structure.
vector_numeric <-c(12, 8, 16, 4, 15)
str(vector_numeric)

#Make a numeric vector,`myNumericVector`, on your own; check its structure.

# Make a logical vector; check its structure.
vector_logical <-c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
str(vector_logical)

# Make a logical vector,`myLogicalVector`on your own; check its structure.

# Make a character vector; check it's structure.
vector_character <-c("Montana", "Aikman", "Manning", "Favre", "Mahomes")
str(vector_character)

# Make a character vector,`myCharVector`on your own; check its structure.

Make a list of the vectors that I created: drAllardList; check its structure.
drAllardList <-list(vector_numeric, vector_logical, vector_character)
str(drAllardList)

Notice a few things about the list: (1) A list is made up of vectors with different types, (2) the list is made up of vectors of different lengths, (3) running str() on list results in console output telling us "List of 3".

# Make a list of the vectors YOU created: myList; check its structure.

# Create data fame: QB_df; print in console; check structure
QB_df <-data.frame(vector_character, vector_numeric, vector_logical)
QB_df
str(QB_df)

# Note: It is a good practice to add'_df" to the names of objects that are data frames.

# print the numeric column to the console; use syntax: dataframe$columnName
QB_df$vector_numeric

# print the the character column to the console; use syntax: dataframe$columnName

# Rename QB_df$vector_character as QB_df$qbName
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_character"] <- "qbName"

str(QB_df)

# What is going on here?

# Select the first row of QB_df
QB_df[1,]

# Select the first column of QB_df
QB_df[,1]

# Select the`qbName`column using ""
QB_df[,"qbName"]

# If you want to keep the complexity of the data frame, you can use the following formats.
QB_df[1]

QB_df["qbName"]

It is important to know the difference between these approaches because we will use each for different reasons.

# Select the cell that is at the intersection of the 3rd row and 2nd column
QB_df[3,2]

#Now it is your turn.
# Select the first row of your dataframe

Select the 3rd column of your dataframe

# Select the cell that is at the intersection of the 1st row and 2nd column of your data frame

# What type of data structure is returned by calling names(QB_df)?
names(QB_df)

## [1] "qbName"         "vector_numeric" "vector_logical"
# Answer: a vector.

# If we want to rename a specific element of the vector, then we need to use indexing to select the element
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_numeric"]

## [1] "vector_numeric"

# Now we need to assign a new value to it.
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_numeric"] <- "jerseyNum"

# Repeat this process for the 3rd column: HoFer (Hall of Famer)
